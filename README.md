# TestingTravisCI 
 Part 1 (already merged with master branch): Test travis.yml setup with flake8, encryption, and requirements.txt. 
 Added unit testing to the travis.yml path. Obtained the green light!
 
 Part 2 (already merged with master branch): Test travis.yml setup with flake8, encryption, and environment.yml. Added virtual environment with miniconda install for testing jupyter notebooks.
 
 Part 3 (abandoned): Part 2 with jupyter notebook that needs win32com.client. Found out that Travis-CI is not compatible with Windows OS. Moving to AppVeyor.

 Part 4 (wrap STK notebooks): Since Travis-CI can not run STK, upload and test csv file generated from STK for testing purposes.
